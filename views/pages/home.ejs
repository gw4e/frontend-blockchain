            An unrealistic and fake crypto money I've created on top of an unrealistic and fake Blockchain i have implemented too !
                Backend is <b>Python</b> made even though, this is my first shot with this language. Web front is <b>Jquery and Bootstrap</b>,
                since I'm not a front guy and i have no clue about React or Vue. Sorry for the design :-)<br><br>
                You can play with this web application to: </p>

            <p style="font-family: Arial">
                A blockchain is a distributed database that is shared among the nodes of a computer network.
                It electronically stores information in digital form.
                They are well known for their fundamental role they play in crypto-money systems,
                to leverage secure and decentralized record of transactions.
            </p>
            <p style="font-family: Arial">Different types of information can be stored on a blockchain, but the most common use so far is as a ledger for money transactions.

            <h3 style="font-family: Arial">What is Block ?</h3>
            A "Block" refers to data being stored in consecutive groups known as "blocks". If you send "Pycotr" to someone else, the transaction data needs to be added to a block to be successful.
            <h3 style="font-family: Arial">What is Chain ?</h3>
            A "Chain" refers to the fact that each block cryptographically references its parent so that blocks get chained together.
            The data in a block cannot change without changing all subsequent blocks, which would require the consensus of the entire network.
            Every nodes in the network must agree upon each new block and the chain as a whole. Nodes ensure everyone interacting
            with the blockchain has the same data. To accomplish this distributed agreement, blockchains need a consensus mechanism.
            <h3 style="font-family: Arial">What is Consensus ?</h3>
            Many nodes works to mine blocks. This means that node who wants to add new blocks to the chain must solve a
            difficult puzzle that requires a lot of computing power. Solving the puzzle "proves" that you have done the "work"
            by using computational resources. Once a node did this work, it needs to tell to other nodes <b>'Hey here my blockchain, please validate,
            and if validated and it is longer than yours then I won the consensus, i will be rewarded and you need to keep my version of the blockchain as yours'</b>.
            This discards the shorter chains, and the longest chain is adopted by the whole network. Nodes stop minin the current block, and try gain with new block
            to become the next winner ! The rewards motivate the node to calculate and mine the longest block.
